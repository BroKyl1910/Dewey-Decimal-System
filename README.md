Dewey Decimal System Learning System
====================================

This is an ASP .NET Core web app. In order to run it, open the solution in Visual Studio and it should be runnable straight away with the run button.

I used SCSS, which is precompiled on build using a grunt task. This shouldn't cause any issues as this only needs to be rerun if there is changes to
styles.scss.

I have added basic test score data in ReplacingBooksScores.csv and IdentifyingAreasScores.csv in the AppData directory.
